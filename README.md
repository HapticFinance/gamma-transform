# Gamma transform

This is an implementation of the gamma transform concept by Guillame Lambert [1]. 

A simple optimization problem to find the amount of Uniswap V3 single tick liquidity position that perfectly hedge the gamma of a long squeeth position.
Squeeth an ETH perpetual by Opyn [2].  

## Why this? 

From [1]
> Why would someone want to hedge a long squeeth? Iâ€™m not entirely sure. While holding a squeeth means that one would need to pay a fixed funding rate, a net positive income may result from shorting ETH (if ETH is shorted on a perp futures exchange) and deploying a Uni v3 LP position (by collecting Uni v3 LP fees).
